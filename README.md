# Project Euler
Complete the first 100 problems from Project Euler

Inspired by [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-new-years-resolution-guide/#the-projecteuler100-challenge-the-dark-souls-of-new-year-s-resolutions) from [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia), the idea is to go through the first 100 problems from the Euler project.

The problems are tackled in the [freeCodeCamp platform and editor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/).
